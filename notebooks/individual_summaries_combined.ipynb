       "  'transcript': \"It's the start of a new year and like\\nmany other YouTubers, it's my one chance\\nwhere I get to pick my top stocks going\\ninto 2026. But this year, I've got to\\nadmit, I feel a little more added\\npressure because of this video right\\nover here from Adriconomics where he\\ncompared several different YouTubers\\npicks for all of 2025. It happens to be\\na great video if you haven't already\\nseen it. And to make a long story short,\\nat the end of the year, I wound up\\ntaking the top spot. First off, I\\nabsolutely love his video concept. And\\nsecond, I'm pretty impressed that most\\nof these YouTubers wound up beating the\\nS&P 500. Hi everyone. If you're new to\\nthe channel, I'm Brian, and I happen to\\nretire six years ago at the age of 46,\\nwhich is only after a 15-year career at\\ncompanies like Target and Amazon. And if\\nyou happen to do the math, then yes, I\\nstarted my career at 31 because I\\nhappened to serve in the Air Force right\\nbefore I went to college. So my whole\\npoint in sharing that is that if you\\nthink that you're starting late in life,\\nlook, I was 31 when I started to invest\\nand it only took me 15 years to retire.\\nSo the whole point is it is never too\\nlate to start. Now, I am not going to\\nwaste a lot of time with a long setup\\nfor this video because if you've seen\\nany of my other videos, then you know\\nthat I have a technology and growth\\nstack focus that happens to be across\\nAI, robotics, and data center\\ninfrastructure, quantum computing, and\\npower generation. And those areas are\\nstill going to be a focus for me this\\nyear. And hey, as just a quick reminder\\nthat I am not a financial adviser and\\nthis is only for educational purposes.\\nAs always, please do your own research.\\nNow, my intent with these stock picks is\\nto let the data tell the story and why\\nthese companies align so well with my\\ninvestment framework. Let's begin with\\nArista Networks, the company that builds\\nthe high-speed networking fabric inside\\ncloud and AI data centers. GPUs may grab\\nthe spotlight, but Arista sells the\\nswitches and the software that allow\\nthose clusters to function at scale. The\\nlong-term trend for them is clean.\\nRevenue expanded from 2.3 billion in\\n2020 to an estimated 8.5 billion in\\n2025, nearly a four times increase in 5\\nyears, or roughly a 30% keer. What\\nstands out to me is that profitability\\nis scaling faster than the sales. Net\\nmargins expanded from 27% to over 42%,\\nmeaning earnings compounded far faster\\nthan the revenue as the business gained\\nits operating leverage. And of course,\\nthat momentum carried over into 2025,\\nwhere revenue growth stepped from the\\nmid teens in early 2024 to the high 20%\\nrange with quarterly revenue reaching\\n2.31 billion and net income up 37%\\nyear-over-year. In this case, the\\npattern matters a little bit more than\\njust a single quarter because the growth\\naccelerated rather than faded as\\nhyperscaler spending continued over time\\nand the cash flow is where Arista\\nseparates from most infrastructure\\nnames. Free cash flow margins exceeded\\n50% supported by capex at well under 1%\\nof revenue generating more than 10\\nbillion in cumulative free cash flow\\nfrom 2023 all through 2025. That cash\\nbuilt a fortress balance sheet. Arista\\nnow holds roughly 9.5 billion in cash\\nand investments against about 60 million\\nin debt, giving the company flexibility\\nwithout relying on external capital as\\nthe cycle begins to evolve. What ties\\nall of this together is their\\npositioning. As AI clusters begin to\\nscale more and more each year,\\nnetworking becomes the overall\\nbottleneck, not compute. And Arista is\\nalready embedded at that layer. The\\ncompany is monetizing hyperscaler\\nrefresh cycles with high 20% revenue\\ngrowth, 40% plus net margins, and 50%\\nplus free cash flow margins all at the\\nsame time. That's a combination that's\\nnearly impossible to replicate in\\ninfrastructure. The single metric for me\\nthat matters most is revenue growth. As\\nlong as it holds in the mid 20% range,\\nhyperscaler spending remains intact.\\nAnalysts give Arista Networks 36% upside\\nover the next 12 months. Next is Applied\\nDigital, a company building large-scale\\nAI data centers designed around two\\nconstraints hyperscalers care about the\\nmost. Compute density and power cost.\\nThe entire model is built on securing\\nlongduration lowcost electricity and\\nlocking them into long-term leases\\nbefore the capacity shortages begin to\\nforce prices higher. The growth curve\\nfor them is extreme where their revenue\\nexpanded from 8 and a half million in\\nfiscal 2022 to 215 million in fiscal 25\\nwith the most recent run rate of around\\n$257 million. And that represents a 194%\\nkagger over four years. That's nearly\\nseven times faster than the broader AI\\ndata center market, which is growing at\\naround 28% annually, translating into a\\n30 times revenue increase driven by\\ninfrastructure that already exists or is\\nunder construction. Now, what separates\\napplied digital from other data centers\\nis where their revenue is anchored. The\\ncompany deliberately builds in powerrich\\nregions like North Dakota, where\\nelectricity is extremely cheap and it's\\nabundant. Locking in lowcost kilowatt\\nhours upfront allows applied digital to\\noffer hyperscalers long-term pricing\\ncertainty while protecting its own\\nmargins over 10 to 15year leases. In\\nthis market right now the cost per\\nkilowatt hour matters a little bit more\\nthan the headline capacity. Now to me\\nfor them the timing happens to be the\\ncatalyst for fiscal 2025. The revenue\\ngrew 58% year-over-year without the\\nfirst major AI facility fully live. The\\nEllenale campus came online in Q4 of\\nlast year, adding roughly $50 million\\nper quarter initially, and it's going to\\nstep up materially higher as additional\\nbuildings ramp up through 2026 and 2027.\\nFor me, margins explain why earning\\npower is being underestimated. Gross\\nmargins compress down into the lower\\nteens during peak construction. That's\\njust buildout costs. That's not even\\npricing pressure. Once facilities are\\nfully leased, the model is targeting\\ngross margins of 45% or higher. And\\nthat's consistent with mature data\\ncenter REITs. For me, the single metric\\nthat matters the most for them is the\\nmegawatts that get placed into service.\\nSo for roughly every 100 megawatt that\\ngoes live, that's going to add roughly\\n200 million in annualized revenue. And\\nit's going to be at incremental margins.\\nWith capacity funded and contracted,\\nexecution, not demand, is really going\\nto drive their outcome. Analysts give\\nApplied Digital 37% upside over the next\\n12 months. All of the companies that are\\nassociated with artificial intelligence,\\nnuclear power, and infrastructure, they\\nall rely on precious metals. And that\\nbrings us today's sponsor of Vanguard\\nMining, which owns gold, copper,\\nlithium, uranium, malibdinum, which I'm\\ngoing to refer to as Molly, and\\npalidium. There are very few companies\\nthat offer more than just one critical\\nmineral, but Vanguard Mining owns a\\ndiversified portfolio of six key\\nmaterials, and it shows in their most\\nrecent one-month return up over 20%.\\nThey hold direct ownership of projects\\nin safe US-friendly jurisdictions\\nincluding Canada, Argentina, and\\nParaguay. Their assets include the\\nBrussels Creek gold copper palladium\\nproject and the Red Copper Mali project\\nin British Columbia. In Argentina, they\\nhold the Pocatosse One Lithium Sailor,\\nwhich is a significant asset as lithium\\nprices have already doubled from their\\n2025 lows. Vanguard also controls over\\n90,000 hectares in Paraguay's Piranha\\nBasin, situated directly next to the\\nworldclass uranium trends. These\\nresources are essential as China\\ncurrently processes 70% of the global\\nlithium and produces 45% of refined\\ncopper. All while their recent export\\ncontrols cause Mali shipments to the\\nwest to collapse by over 95%. Now Mali\\nis critical for hardening and\\nstrengthening of all other metals. By\\nsecuring these supplies, Vanguard is\\nproviding the materials necessary for\\nthe 24/7 carbon-f free power\\nrequirements from these big tech data\\ncenters and national infrastructure. So\\nif you'd like to learn more about\\nVanguard Mining, please check out the\\nlinks down in the description. Next is\\nAervironment, a company that has moved\\nfrom a niche drone supplier into a\\nbroader defense technology platform. The\\ngrowth does look a little bit dramatic\\nat first glance, but the real story is\\nhow that growth was created and what has\\nto work next. For most of fiscal 2025,\\nquarterly revenue ran around 170 to $190\\nmillion and then it stepped up to $275\\nmillion and quickly moved above 450\\nmillion per quarter. That massive jump\\nwas not organic. It was from a $4.1\\nbillion Blue Halo acquisition which did\\nhappen to triple their revenue and it\\nadded Lasers, Space System, and Counter\\nUAS. And that same acquisition explains\\nwhat you're seeing in their margins.\\nGross margins fell from the low 40%\\nrange down into the high teens. And\\nthat's driven by a heavier service mix\\nand a sharp increase in amortization.\\nThe revenue had changed overnight in a\\ngood way, but the profitability didn't.\\nThe market already accepts the revenue\\nreset. The focus now is squarely going\\nto be on integration. Now, for me, what\\nI think is going to support the\\nlong-term case is their scale. Their\\nmost important product, their\\nSwitchblade, their production had\\nincreased roughly sixfold in about a\\nyear, and capacity is being built to\\nsupport thousands of units annually.\\nThese systems are combat proven and\\nthey're already deployed at scale which\\nseparates AVA from their competitors\\nwhich are still validating designs\\nrather than delivering volume. And\\nsomething that I love is that backlog\\nadds durability to their scale. Funded\\nbacklog grew from roughly $400 million\\nto more than $750 million with total\\nbookings now exceeding $1 billion.\\nLongdated Army and Air Force contracts\\nextend revenue visibility into the next\\ndecade and they move AVA a little bit\\ncloser to platform style defense\\nsupplier rather than episodic hardware\\nsales. Now what I think is going to\\ndrive the next phase is the stack around\\ndrones. Drones happen to remain their\\nbread and butter. Lasers address the\\nrising cost of defending against mass\\ndrone threats. And cyber and space\\nlengthen contracts and embed AVA into\\nmulti-year programs. That's a pretty\\ngood balance of volume, relevance, and\\ndurability all in one platform. To me,\\nthe single most important metric is\\ntheir gross margins. The collapse into\\nthe high teens reflects acquisition\\naccounting. It's not a mix problem and\\nit's not a demand problem. and the\\nrecovery to get them back into that mid\\n20% range is really that hinge on their\\nearnings as the integration begins to\\nprogress. Analysts give Aero environment\\na big whopping 1% upside over the next\\n12 months. Now, this one is a good one\\nto wait for on the dip. For me, it kind\\nof stinks because it went up about 40%\\nin the past 2 weeks while I was in the\\nprocess of putting this video together,\\nand I'm really glad that it was already\\nin my portfolio going into the year. Our\\nnext company is Ion Q. Now, most quantum\\ncompanies are still trying to prove the\\ntechnology or they're trying to force a\\nbusiness model on top of it. Ion Q is\\npushing both forward at the same time\\nand that's finally starting to show up\\nin their real results. Quarterly revenue\\njumped from the low teens millions to\\nnearly 40 million in Q3 of 2025. Almost\\nall of 2024 revenue in a single quarter.\\nThat one single step change shifted ION\\nQ from a research story to an operating\\nbusiness. And I think that margins\\nreally explain their approach because\\ngross margins have sat below 10% by\\ndesign. Ionq has been willing to sell\\nsystems at near cost to get embedded\\nearly with governments and enterprises.\\nAnd I think that they're banking that\\nthe payoff comes later as access, usage,\\nand services begin to matter more than\\nthe hardware itself. Where ion Q stands\\nout from the rest is its fidelity. Two\\ncubit gate fidelity at 99.99%\\nmeans error correction becomes\\npractical. Fewer physical cubits are\\nneeded to do useful work. ION Q wins on\\nreliability which shortens the path to\\nreal workloads. The stock already\\nreacted to that progress once, running\\nfrom about $8 to the mid $80 in 2025 and\\nthen pulling back roughly 40% and\\nsettling at around $50. That looks like\\nconsolidation after a major repricing.\\nTo me, it's not a broken story at all.\\nNow, what ties this together for them is\\nthe shift from selling a system to\\nbecoming the system. Ion Q is using\\nearly contracts to get embedded, and its\\ntechnical lead gives customers a reason\\nto stay embedded as workloads begin to\\ngrow. For Ion Q, the single metric that\\nmatters the most to me is their revenue\\ntrajectory. Continued stepups confirm\\nION Q is turning Quantum into a real\\nplatform business. Analysts give ion Q\\n49% upside over the next 12 months. That\\nnow brings us to our favorite AI company\\nof Nvidia, which isn't just a chip\\nsupplier anymore because it's the\\nplatform that's underneath all of modern\\ncompute. Data center revenue hit 51\\nbillion in Q3 of fiscal 26 and that is\\nup 66% year-over-year and it's now\\nmaking up 90% of their total revenue\\nwhere that scale funds everything else\\nthat Nvidia is building leading to the\\nVera Ruba platform which delivers five\\ntimes inference performance three and a\\nhalf times training and it runs tokens\\nat onetenth the cost lower token cost\\nmeans everything in the world of AI and\\nexpands how much AI can be deployed at\\nscale. These gains come at the system\\nlevel. It's compute, networking, memory,\\nand software designed all together to\\nwork together. That's why customers buy\\nentire racks, not just chips. And their\\ndemand just keeps building because\\ncompute now scales three different ways.\\nIt's training, its post-training, and\\nits inference. That combination is what\\nsustains infrastructure demand even as\\nindividual models begin to mature. And\\nof course, software adds another layer.\\nOn top of all of that, Nvidia AI\\nEnterprise is running at a 2 billion\\nplus annual pace, growing triple digits.\\nRecurring revenue that compounds as the\\ninstalled base also continues to grow.\\nTo me, their runway ahead, it still\\nremains so large and so far out there.\\nMost global computing infrastructure\\nstill hasn't even transitioned to\\naccelerated compute, which leaves years\\nof modernization ahead for companies\\nlike Nvidia. The single metric that\\nmatters most to me about Nvidia is their\\ndata center revenue growth. As long as\\nthat remains strong, then it confirms to\\nthe world that Nvidia's role is at the\\nvery center of this compute transition.\\nAnd even today, analysts are showing\\nNvidia a lot of love with 44% upside\\nover the next 12 months. Our next\\ncompany is Lamb Research, one of the\\ncore companies sitting behind every\\nadvanced chip build. Now, Lamb doesn't\\njust design chips. It supplies the etch\\nand the deposition tools that make\\nadvanced logic and memory possible at\\nscale. Looking at a wide range, their\\nrevenue grew from 1.6 billion in fiscal\\n2006 to 18.4 billion in fiscal 2025.\\nThat is an 11 times increase, which is\\nalso roughly double the broader\\nsemiconductor market's growth rate at\\nthe same time. That happens to be\\nstructural share gain. It's not just\\ncycle exposure. And then gross margins\\nstayed flat, but operating margins\\nexpanded from the mid20s to 32%. And net\\nmargins hit 29%. That's the definition\\nof operating leverage. Fixed costs like\\nR&D don't rise as fast as revenue. So\\nprofits begin to scale faster than the\\nsales. The cycle profile has improved\\ntoo. Draw downs moved from 56% during\\nthe GFC to roughly -15% in the most\\nrecent normalization. Lamb captures the\\nupside without giving it all back in the\\ndownturns. For me, the current driver\\nfor them is high bandwidth memory or\\nHBM. Each stack requires two to three\\ntimes more edge steps per wafer,\\ndirectly increasing LAM's content per\\nchip. With HBM production growing at 50%\\nor more annually through the next two\\nyears, this is a new demand vector and\\nit's not like the normal memory\\ntrajectory that you would see where it\\nwould boom and bust every other year.\\nLamb generated 5.7 billion of free cash\\nflow in fiscal 2025 at a 31% free cash\\nflow margin, returning 80% to\\nshareholders through buybacks and\\ndividends. And as chips get more\\ncomplex, manufacturing steps rise. And\\nLamb's tools sit directly in that path.\\nAI and HBM make manufacturing a heck of\\na lot harder, which only increases\\nLamb's relevance over time. Now, in this\\nscenario, the single metric that matters\\nthe most is operating margin. As long as\\nmargins expand faster than the revenue\\nduring recoveries, it confirms Lamb's\\noperating leverage is still intact. This\\nis one that I will keep on the ready to\\nbuy whenever there's a future dip. Now,\\nthis next company is Amazon, which many\\nof you know is my former employer. And\\nfor this one, the only way to really\\nunderstand this stock is to zoom out,\\nand I mean zoom way out. Amazon has\\nnever moved smoothly. It surges ahead of\\nthe market and then it spends years\\ngoing sideways while the business begins\\nto catch up. From 2010 to 2014, it\\nabsolutely exploded. And then of course\\nit stalled. From 2015 to 2018 it broke\\nout again. And then of course it went\\nflat again. After the 2020 surge, the\\nstock for the most part has been\\nsideways. I mean to summarize it, they\\ntend to outperform in micro bursts and\\nthen they'll underperform or just pause\\nfor long periods. That's always been\\ntheir pattern. And strangely, the\\nbreakout never really comes at peak\\nexcitement. It just comes after a lot of\\nboredom. Since 2023, Amazon is up 15 to\\n20% while the S&P 500 is up 45 to 50%. 2\\nyears of underperformance right on\\npattern. Now AWS growth is accelerating\\nback towards 20%. And historically,\\nAmazon doesn't leave holding patterns\\nuntil AWS turns first. Operating income\\nsurged from 12 billion in 2022 to 69\\nbillion in 2024. That's five times\\ngrowth in just 2 years. free cash flow\\nswung from negative to 30 billion plus.\\nThis isn't just cost cutting, it's\\noperating leverage showing up at scale.\\nAnd yes, data center spending is rising\\nagain, but unlike past cycles, this\\nbuildout is being funded by profits, not\\njust balance sheet stress. Thankfully,\\nAmazon is starting to invest from their\\nstrength. And today, the setup mirrors\\nprior breakouts. The stock compressed\\nnear highs. Momentum is constructive but\\nnot overheated and volume is starting to\\nexpand. So it's the same backdrop that\\nwe see today. In my mind, Amazon has\\ndone the hard part. Margins rebuilt,\\ncash flow restored, AWS is reignited.\\nThe stock spent years consolidating\\nhistorically. That is the setup. It's\\nnot the aftermath of the next move. Now\\nfor them, the metric that matters the\\nmost to me is returns as data center\\ncapacity begins to fill. If they happen\\nto hold, then Amazon exits another\\npause, and history says it won't stay\\nquiet very long. Analysts give Amazon\\n24% upside over the next 12 months. This\\nnow brings us to Advanced Micro Devices\\nor AMD. And the right way to frame AMD\\nright now is that the stock is being\\npriced like growth is slowing down.\\nWhile the data obviously is saying the\\nopposite. AMD grew revenue from 10\\nbillion in 2020 to 34 billion in 2025.\\nSo that's three times within five years.\\nThis is not a turnaround story anymore\\nbecause they are a very large, very\\ndiversified semiconductor company. AMD\\ntrades at 28 to 30 times forward\\nearnings. But pair that with expected\\ngrowth and the PEG ratio is a 0.47.\\nAnd of course, a PEG ratio below a one\\nimplies undervaluation.\\nBelow 0.5 means the market is\\ndiscounting growth heavily. Even though\\nearnings say a completely different\\nstory. Their data center revenue grew\\n60% plus year-over-year in 2025 and is\\nnow AMD's most important profit driver.\\nThese are higher margin dollars that\\nmatter a heck of a lot more than the old\\nPC heavy model. Reported earnings look a\\nlittle bit messy because AMD is carrying\\n$3 billion a year in non-cash\\namortization from Zillinks. That\\ndepresses the gap earnings, but it\\ndoesn't affect cash where free cash flow\\nhit 2.4 billion, up sharply\\nyear-over-year. I I really don't think\\nthat income statement has caught up to\\nthe business quite yet. AMD right now is\\nmoving from chips to rack scale AI\\nsystems through 2026. Customers love to\\nbuy systems, not just chips. So, revenue\\nper deployment rises without needing\\nexplosive unit growth. Since 2023, AMD\\nhas gone sideways while revenue scaled.\\nCash flow improved and the valuation\\njust happened to compress. The stock has\\nnever really run ahead of its\\nfundamentals. It's just been waiting.\\nThat's the mismatch. You have a peg at a\\n0.47. Rising data center exposure,\\nimproving cash generation, and earnings\\nthat are still being dampened from that\\nlatest acquisition, which is just\\naccounting noise. Historically, AMD\\ndoesn't stay priced like this once the\\nearnings visibility begins to improve.\\nWhen it comes to AMD, the metric that\\nmatters most to me is that PEG ratio. As\\nlong as growth holds and the PEG stays\\nthis low, the market is betting growth\\nwon't last, even though it already is.\\nAnalysts are giving Advanced Micro\\nDevices AMD 27% upside over the next 12\\nmonths. And there you have it. That is\\nmy stock picks for 2026 at the very\\nbeginning of the year. and I certainly\\nhope that it treats all of us well. Um,\\nas you can tell, some of them spiked\\nquite a bit while I was writing this,\\nbut instead of replacing them, I figured\\nI had the conviction to stand behind\\nthem before I wrote it. I'm going to\\nkeep with it.

Today, I got\\nfour stocks with the biggest upside for\\n2026.\\nBut more importantly than I\\'m looking\\nlongterm. I want you guys to be thinking\\nfrom now to 2030, these are going to be\\nyour winners, guys. What I like to do\\nfor you all, I remember I put the world\\non Palunteer, for example, when it was\\n$8 and I was talking about it. Yeah, it\\ngot busy when I talked about it, but it\\nwas more about the longer term outlook.\\nThese plays today are going to be\\nsimilar for you guys, and I want you to\\nmake sure you [music] have them in the\\nfold somewhere on your journey. Okay? Do\\nme that favor. Also, man, remember this,\\nguys. The people closest to you can\\ndrain your future if you don\\'t draw the\\nline. In 2026, I want you guys to make\\nsure you put healthy boundaries in place\\nbetween you co-workers, you family, you\\nfriends, you and anybody\\nthat you through discernment and\\neverything else can sense don\\'t mean you\\nwell or just trying to drain your\\npositive energy or down where you\\'re\\ntrying to ultimately go in terms of your\\ntrajectory for yourself and in your\\nfuture. [music] Okay, be mindful of that\\nfor coach. Okay, the people closest to\\nyou can drain you and your future if you\\ndon\\'t draw the line. Remember that for\\nme, okay, as always guys, please make\\nsure like, subscribe, help this video\\nget at least 1,000 likes. So, without\\nfurther ado, let\\'s go ahead and dive\\ninto it. Man, check it out, guys. I told\\nyou I got four out the gate. Now, shout\\nout to everybody that was on the live\\nwith us and was able to get busy off of\\nsome of the call outs from last night\\nthat did their thing today. One thing\\nI\\'m noticing about this market, guys, is\\nthey are not allowing you to sit and\\noverstay your welcome. You for real got\\nto get in and get up out of there. Okay?\\nAnd I\\'m going to be on you guys about\\nthat because if you\\'re new to the game,\\nif you just finding out who I am and you\\ndon\\'t know how we put it down, you don\\'t\\nknow the nuances of how we make so much\\nmoney. You don\\'t know the nuances of why\\nso many people have so much success. And\\nit\\'s little things such as like knowing\\nwhen to get in and when to get out.\\nKnowing how high and how far a play may\\ngo before it\\'s time to exit. Okay?\\nKnowing how to spot a reversal, all\\nthose little nuances. Okay. But WDC,\\nuh, KTOS,\\na few plays did decent, but it, listen\\nto this, but it didn\\'t maintain the\\nwhole entire day. Okay, but check this\\nout, guys. Coreweave, ticker symbol\\nCRWV.\\nNot only do this stock has huge upside\\nfor this year, 2026, [music] but coach\\nis thinking by 2030. Let me know if\\nthat\\'s understood. By 2030,\\nthis will be one of your ones. This will\\nbe one of your household names. Not that\\nit\\'s not picking up traction now, but by\\n2030,\\nyou\\'re going to see this be something\\nthat\\'s talked about at a much higher\\ncapacity than it is today. Okay? Coach\\nwants you to be aware. And if this one\\nmakes your list, this is when you build\\nout not only for the shorter term, but I\\nneed you guys to be thinking longer\\nterm. Everybody say longterm. Okay,\\nCRWV, Core Wee. Okay, don\\'t get this\\nmixed up with CrowdStrike cuz they\\'re\\nvery similar in their ticker symbols.\\nOkay, it\\'s sitting at $95. The next one,\\nguys, is Verive. Verive Holdings, ticker\\nsymbol VRT. Now, this one is sitting at\\n$170.54.\\nAnd once again, in terms of where the\\nworld is headed, the things that are\\ncoming down the pipe now, meaning the\\nthings that are the foundation that is\\nbeing laid will plate into what will be\\nsuccessful years down the road. Let me\\nknow if that makes sense. Okay. So, say\\nfor example, guys, I remember Pelaton\\nwas popping during CO because everybody\\nwas at home and you couldn\\'t go to the\\ngym. But if you caught that, you did\\nwell. But listen to this. coming out of\\nCOVID and everybody got back outside and\\nstart moving around again. Pelaton stock\\ncrashed because all that at home workout\\nnow we can go back to the gym and we got\\nthe Pelaton at the gym. We no longer\\nneeded that. That stock the sales and\\neverything associated with that stock\\nfell. I\\'m trying to put you on to plays\\nnow that you guys can get yourself\\nfamiliar with so they\\'re not brand new\\nto you in 2030. Like, nope, coach\\ndropped his nugget on us way back when.\\nNow we lock, loaded, and ready to go.\\nNow we\\'re seeing our wealth really\\ncompound because of the insight he gave\\nus on the front end. Okay, so Verdiff\\nHoldings, ticker symbol VRT, that\\'s one\\nthat I got for you guys. The next one,\\nthis one is not new to you guys. Irene,\\nticker symbol Irene. Now, in terms of\\nupside, this one is already been getting\\nbusy. This one is already one that has\\nalready kind of made some major moves.\\nBut just because a stock makes major\\nmoves, sometimes that\\'s the flaw a lot\\nof new investors make, thinking\\nsomething can\\'t keep going higher\\nbecause it made a move already. If this\\npulls back, when this pull back, guys,\\nyou need to be licking your chops,\\nthis particular stock will be one day\\nlike 2030\\npossibly. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if\\nthis is around $70 to $80 and $100\\nwouldn\\'t even be out the rim of\\npossibility. Okay, if the right momentum\\ncome in, if the right institutional\\nbuyers come into it, [music] if the\\nright buyers step in. Okay, Irene, put\\nthis again on your I know it\\'s on your\\nradar now cuz you rock with coach, but\\nI\\'m talking about seeing it even bigger\\npicture and seeing it even longer term.\\nOkay, let me know if that\\'s understood.\\nAll right. And then Bloom Energy, ticker\\nsymbol BE. This one is sitting at $139.\\nThis one is already up hundreds of\\npercents. You know what I\\'m saying? Near\\nterm. But listen to this guys. If the\\nworld is truly\\nabout to be focused on these data\\ncenters and all this AI,\\nyou going to need power to power all of\\nthis stuff to power all of these data\\ncenters. And the only company that\\'s in\\nthe stock market right now that\\'s\\npublicly traded that\\'s in position to\\nhandle all that that\\'s in position to\\nsolve that problem guys is Bloom Energy.\\nOkay. Ticker symbol BE. Everybody write\\nthis down. Ticker symbol B. Bloom\\nEnergy. Okay. They have the grids. They\\nhave the mechanisms in place already to\\nsolve the problem that many people don\\'t\\neven know they\\'re going to run into yet.\\nBut when they do, boom going to be here\\nlike how we be. They going to be here\\nlike this. Yep. Like, \"Yep, come on in\\nhere. Come on in here. We got you\\ncovered [music] and let\\'s run this bag\\nall the way up.\" Okay. And so now this\\nparticular company has a huge upside for\\n2026, but coach is thinking even longer\\nterm. Write these down and mark my words\\nabout where these four plays will be by\\n2030. That\\'s what that\\'s what I want you\\nto do. That\\'s how I want you looking at\\nthis. Okay? Do me that favor, guys. And\\nremember, the people closest to you can\\ndrain your future if you don\\'t draw the\\nline. Okay? So, I need you to know the\\nimportance of while you\\'re on your\\ninvesting journey, you got to protect\\nyour peace and protect your boundaries\\nall the while. Okay? You can\\'t just be\\nout here [music]\\nletting people do any and everything and\\nyou you let it slide once, you let it\\nslide twice. No, people know what\\nthey\\'re doing, okay? People know what\\nthey\\'re doing and now it\\'s time for you\\nto do what you got to do, okay? because\\nthey\\'ll jeopardize your future if you\\nkeep letting them play with you and you\\nrefuse to draw the line. Okay? Listen,\\nman. I want to say major salute to those\\nof you that\\'s doing your thing. I want\\nto say, listen, as this new year kicks\\noff, at the top of the year, guys, you\\nhave a chance to really kind of get your\\nducks in a row, get your affairs in\\norder. And I really want you to take\\nheed to that, okay? on the 100k\\nchallenge. I\\'m going to be sending you\\nguys emails. I\\'m going to be just having\\nsome soft touch points here and there to\\nkeep you not only going but encouraged\\nalong the journey. Of course, we are\\ngoing to have awesome awesome plays and\\nopportunities to take advantage of. But\\nyou got to be locked in. You got to be\\nlocked loaded, ready to go. And you have\\nto understand this is not get rich\\nquick. I walk the whole 12 months down\\nwith you guys, okay? and we walk it out\\ntogether. [music] And so you need to\\nhave a longterm\\nmindset understanding that a lot of\\nstuff can happen quicker for you. Let me\\nknow if that\\'s understood. For example,\\nwe was on live yesterday\\nand uh I saw a lift come up a couple\\ntimes and the people that\\'s just jumping\\nin don\\'t even already know we had it\\nsince 14. It\\'s done ran to 23. That\\'s\\nlifechanging money for the people that\\'s\\nnot fully understanding that play. But\\nthis is a 2027 play just getting you\\nguys in early. So at 19, 18, anywhere\\nunder $20, you still had the upside\\npotential once the market kind of firms\\nup a little bit and gets on better\\nfooting and these earnings start coming\\nin and positive sentiment start coming\\nback into the market, you\\'re going to\\nsee things like Lyft take off. And\\nlisten to this, if nothing else, you\\nstill got it to 2027. It don\\'t have to\\ntake off tomorrow. So, that\\'s what I\\nmean about having the right mindset.\\nSome stuff is not going to be something\\nthat\\'s going to happen right away. If\\nyou have the get-richqu mindset, it\\'s\\ngoing to make you frustrated on this\\njourney versus letting things\\norganically happen and take shape. All\\nright, guys. Listen, man. Coach just\\nwanted to touch base with you guys\\ntoday. Put them four on your radar\\nbecause they got the hugest upside not\\nonly for 2026, but for the next four\\nyears as well. dock that for me. And\\nlisten, we make videos like this every\\nday. So if you like this one, make sure\\nyou check out the next one. Remember,\\nmost people see the end result. Very if\\nyou consider the journey, do me a favor.\\nDon\\'t forget to like, subscribe to the\\nchannel. Make sure you guys grab some\\nfree stocks using my link below.

And\\nliterally, as I\\'m recording this,\\nReuters just broke the news there could\\nbe a lot more to this. The US is also\\nintroducing a bill to create a stockpile\\nof critical minerals.

I give you also the risks\\nand the opportunities and then you can\\ndo your own research, make your own\\ndecisions. Does that sound fair? If it\\nsounds fair, put an F in the chat or in\\nthe comments and let\\'s freaking go. So\\nhere\\'s the deal that shocked the world,\\nparticularly the Wall Street world.\\nTrump announced a $1.6 billion\\ninvestment in USA, USA rare earths,\\nticker symbol USA. And in exchange for\\nthat money, the US government gets a 10%\\nstake in the company. So, let me\\ntranslate that for you. The government\\nbecame a major shareholder in a mining\\ncompany. Remember the last time that\\nhappened? So, this isn\\'t the government\\ngiving out loans to some boring\\ndevelopment bank. This is Papa Sam\\nsaying, \"We\\'re going into the mining\\nbusiness.\" Yeah. It\\'s no longer drill,\\nbaby drill. It\\'s dig, baby, dig.

Well, rare\\nearth elements are 17 specific metals\\nthat you\\'ve probably never heard of.\\nthings like neodymium and prodmium and\\ndisplosium and weird things sort of\\nHarry Potter spell sounding minerals but\\nthe thing is you can\\'t build any modern\\ntechnology without these every single\\nelectric motor needs it every rare earth\\nmagnet is built from that every wind\\nturbine every F-35 fighter jet yeah it\\'s\\nloaded with rare earths your iPhone yeah\\nrare earths in there too so the problem\\nhere is well it\\'s an opportunity now\\nthere is a geopolitical reality here and\\nthat is that China controls 90% of\\nglobal rare earth processing not the\\nmining the processing because rare\\nearths aren\\'t that rare that\\'s it\\'s\\nweirdly named they\\'re not that rare\\nactually they\\'re kind of everywhere all\\nover the place but processing them it\\'s\\nkind of dirty it\\'s expensive it\\'s\\ncomplicated some have like radiation\\nradiation issues can take years to set\\nthat up. So for the last 30 years, we\\nbasically said, \"All right, uh, let\\'s\\nsend it to somewhere far away and let\\nthem deal with it.\" That\\'s essentially\\nwhat happened. And now, shockingly, the\\nUS has discovered that maybe relying on\\nwell, what appears to be a rivalry\\nbetween these two nations, um, if you\\nneed your opponent to build weapons\\nsystem, might not be the smartest\\nstrategic decision, right? So there have\\nbeen a few presidents there who somebody\\nshould just walk up to and you know\\nshake them very gently. I\\'m not\\nproposing any violence against former uh\\npresidents. That would not be a good\\nthing I imagine. But what is it that is\\nactually going on here? What is USA?\\nWhat are they actually building? So\\nthey\\'re not just digging up rocks these\\nguys. And I\\'m going to give you a whole\\nlist of stocks that I believe will\\nbenefit from this tremendously by the\\nway. So so stick around. But they\\'re\\nbuilding what they call a mine tomagnet\\nsupply chain. And that means they mine\\nthe stuff. They\\'ve got a massive deposit\\ncalled Round Top in Sierra Blanca uh in\\nTexas, which sounds like a sort of um a\\nkind of place you should you should film\\nat Western, isn\\'t it? Uh anyway, never\\nbeen there in my life. Never been to\\nTexas. I hear it\\'s a fun place. But they\\nhave 15 of the 17 rare earth metals\\nright there. Right now, the second thing\\nis they\\'re going to process it, right?\\nturn that ore into usable rare earth\\noxides and then they\\'re going to\\nmanufacture magnets from them. So\\nthey\\'re building a massive 310,000\\nsquare ft magnet facility in Still\\nWater, Oklahoma, all of America, all\\ncontrolled domestically. And the mine,\\nthe Roundtop mine is expected to start\\noperations by 2028. You\\'re like 2028?\\nIt\\'s too far away. Well, in mining\\nworld, it\\'s like it\\'s like a second.\\nTakes ages to develop this stuff. The\\nfactory, it\\'s supposed to come online\\nthis year. First commercial production\\nline actually in 2026. So, I guess\\nthey\\'re going to buy in some minerals\\nand then process them. So, now let me\\nask you this. Do you think the US\\ngovernment would write a $ 1.6 billion\\ncheck if they thought this was, you\\nknow, nonsense? This is a bet that rare\\nearths are going to be absolutely\\ncritical for the next decade and beyond.\\nAnd whoever controls the supply chain\\ncontrols the future. It\\'s bright. It\\'s\\norange. It\\'s it\\'s a random reference\\nthere for my my my British viewers. Now,\\nhere is where this gets important for us\\nas investors.\\nEveryone\\'s talking about AI, right?\\nChat, GPT, Claude, all these large\\nlanguage models. Everyone thinks AI is\\njust software, just code sitting in some\\ncloud somewhere. Well, it\\'s what? AI is\\nmassively physical and it\\'s creating an\\nabsolute feeding frenzy for raw\\nmaterials. Let me show you why. Data\\ncenters are the new factories. AI models\\nneed enormous computing power which\\nmeans enormous data centers. So by 2030,\\nwhich is in only four years, which is\\nkind of weird because that used to be\\nthe future, data centers are going to\\nconsume 1,000 terowatt hours of\\nelectricity. Now, I don\\'t really know\\nwhat that means, but it sounds like a\\nlot. But I can put it into perspective,\\nright? I always say we shouldn\\'t make a\\nvideo without digging on the French. Uh,\\nhere we are. Uh, the entire electricity\\nconsumption of France is what the data\\ncenters will use.\\nDoesn\\'t make you so big and proud now,\\ndoes it my French viewers? So, what does\\nit mean for us? Well, all right. So,\\nwe\\'ve got some metals here, right? We\\'re\\ngoing to go through the metals and we\\'re\\ngoing to go through the actual stocks to\\nsee, you know, which are the right ones.\\nCopper. Copper is the king metal. Every\\nsingle data center needs massive amount\\nof copper for power transmission. Think\\nwiring, cooling systems, backup\\ngenerators. The AI sector could account\\nfor 3% of global copper demand. Doesn\\'t\\nsound like a lot, right? 3%. But you\\nsee, there is already a deficit. There\\'s\\nmore demand for copper than there is\\nactually copper being dug out of the\\nground. It\\'s been a deficit since 2024\\nand it\\'s expected to stay in deficit\\nthrough all of this year and beyond. So,\\nthink about that. Demand\\'s going up.\\nSupply isn\\'t keeping up the pace and\\nwe\\'re about to add the equivalent of\\nFrance\\'s power consumption in new data\\ncenters, right? So, what happens to\\nprices when supply is tight and demand\\ngoes? I\\'ll let you work that one out for\\nyourself. You can put it in the comments\\nif you thought you had a particularly\\nbrilliant thought around this subject.\\nNow, steel and aluminium, which is, you\\nknow, Winston, they are also really\\nboring, but they can make a lot of\\nmoney. Each hypers scale data center,\\nthe bigger ones, require 20,000 tons of\\nsteel just for the structure. Tons of\\naluminium for the server racks and the\\nheat sinks. It\\'s not sexy. Nobody\\'s\\nmaking YouTube videos about aluminum,\\nbut when you need 20,000 tons of it for\\none building and you\\'re building\\nhundreds of these things, well, then\\nthat\\'s kind of gets interesting. And\\nthen, of course, we got what everybody\\ntalks about, which is chips, right? The\\nGPUs that actually run these AI models.\\nThey\\'re going to be TPUs and CPUs, but\\nit\\'s all chips. Just chips, right? Not\\nthe stuff you can eat, but the, you know\\nwhat I mean? Um, now these things are\\nkind of miraculous, but they need a\\nbunch of stuff to operate. They think\\nneed things like gallium, which I don\\'t\\nknow why it\\'s called gallium. German\\ngermanmanium. It sort of sounds like\\nwhat was that? What was that cartoon\\nwith me a little? There was a big fat\\nguy who was throwing rocks at Roman\\nsoldiers and they were always in France,\\nright? That was in in in Gaul, which is\\nold word for France. And then Germanium\\nsounds like Germany, doesn\\'t it? Very\\nodd. Anyway, my mind wanders. Um,\\ngallium is essential for high\\nperformance ships. Geranium is used for\\nfiber optics, for high-speed data\\ntransmissions. And then there\\'s the fun\\npart. Well, China controls 98% of\\ngallium and 60% of geranium production,\\nright? So, the US might want to build\\nsome of that. So, Silicon Valley is uh\\nkind of going, yeah, guys, you got to\\nyou got to do something about it. Now,\\nhow did the US get here? Well, Silicon\\nValley runs the the tech world and and\\nthey\\'re going to buy it wherever it\\'s\\ncheapest until the US government\\nliterally passes a law forcing them to\\nstop, which is what just happened\\nbasically. So before we dive into the\\nactual stocks, I want you guys to not\\nfollow random stock picks on YouTube\\nbecause it\\'s going to get you into\\ntrouble. I want you guys to understand\\nthe actual principle behind it so you\\ncan make better decisions. How do you\\nlearn the actual principle? Well, I\\nlearned it from my mentors who are Wall\\nStreet guys. And I will show you in a\\nsecond. By the way, in our community, I\\nput out a a a watch list every Sunday\\nwith the actual stocks. So, we\\'re going\\nto look at those in a second. But\\nif you want to be smart about this and\\nyou want to actually have the skills, so\\nyou\\'re not just buying something and\\nthen go, \"Wait, wait, when do I sell?\"\\nWhich is what people always say to me.\\nI\\'m like, \"You should have figured that\\nout before you bought it, right?\" Which\\nis an annoying thing to say, but it\\'s\\ntrue. So, if you want to learn that\\nprocess, go to felix.org/getfree.\\nIt\\'s short video. I think it\\'s 17\\nminutes long. And I actually walk you\\nthrough the actual physical hard steps\\nof sector selection, stock selection,\\nand and and and when we exit. So if you\\nwant to get a little bit deeper into\\nmanaging your money in a more serious\\nfashion, I\\'d highly recommend you do\\nthat. There\\'s a link to it down below,\\nfelix.org/getfree.\\nBut before we dive into the individual\\nnames and and we shall uh will you talk\\nabout the bigger picture because we\\'re\\nseeing something that isn\\'t just one\\ncompany or one metal going up, we\\'re\\npotentially of the start of what\\'s\\ncalled a super cycle. Now, what\\'s a\\nsuper cycle? Well, a super cycle is\\nbasically when commodity prices stay way\\nabove normal for a really, really,\\nreally, really long time. So, we\\'re\\ntalking 10, 15, sometimes 20 years. This\\nisn\\'t just a normal boom and bust cycle\\nwhere prices go up for 18 months and\\nthen crash, which is usually what\\nhappens. This is a structural thing.\\nThis is long-term demand that isn\\'t\\ngoing away. Now, the last big super\\ncycle was from 2000 to 2014.\\nWhy do we have that super cycle? China\\nbuilt China. You know, all the\\ninfrastructure. If you\\'ve been,\\neverything is modern. High-rise\\nbuildings, high-speed trains,\\ninfrastructure, just everywhere, right?\\nBrand new airports, all that kind of\\nstuff. So, they build a lot. And if you\\nown mining stocks during that time, you\\ndid very, very, very well. You\\nAustralians down there under you. You\\nknow what I\\'m talking about, right? That\\nthat drove the big the big Australia\\nboom. And I I used to work for McQuary,\\na big Australian bank. So, a lot of my\\nfriends spent a lot of money on that.\\nNow, since the beginning of\\n2025,\\nthe metals and mining index has gained\\nnearly 90%. It\\'s outperformed tech\\nstocks. It\\'s outperformed everything.\\nAnd yet, mining stocks are still trading\\nat a 20% discount to their price to book\\nratio compared to the broader market.\\nSo, the sector is up 90%. And it\\'s still\\nrelatively cheap compared to history.\\nSo, what does that tell you? It tells\\nyou the market is just starting to wake\\nup to this. Wake up people. Right. So\\nthe super cycle is being driven by three\\nmassive trends happening at the same\\ntime. We have the AI boom. I just showed\\nyou that data centers, the chips, the\\ninfrastructure. This isn\\'t going to go\\naway. AI only just started. It\\'s like\\nthe internet in, you know, 1997 or\\nsomething. The energy transition comes\\nwith electric vehicles, wind turbines,\\nsolar panels, all incredibly metal\\nintensive. An EV, an electric vehicle\\nuser, uses three times more copper than\\na regular gas. A single wind turbine\\nuses about 4.7 tons of copper. And then\\nyou get defense. Countries are rearming.\\nDefense budgets are going up. The US,\\nTrump wants to put up the defense budget\\nby 60%. Every missile, every jet, every\\nship is loaded with copper, aluminium,\\nrare earths, uranium, all that stuff.\\nAnd what are they building? Well,\\nthey\\'re building more electric things,\\nright? Drones, autonomous tanks and\\nplanes and ships and submarines. What\\nare they all going to need? Well, a ton\\nof all the things to make electric\\nmotors with, which is rare earth\\nminerals. So, you\\'ve got this three\\nsecular trends thing happening at the\\nsame time, all multi-deade, all\\nrequiring the same materials. And the\\nproblem is, and again, the opportunity,\\nif you\\'re positioned correctly, the\\nsupply side is broken. We\\'ve been\\nunderinvesting in new mines for over a\\ndecade. Why? Because after the last\\nsuper cycle crashed by 2015, nobody\\nwanted to touch mining. It was like the\\ncrazy thing. Don\\'t touch mining. Prices\\nwere low. Returns were terrible. No\\none\\'s going to go, I\\'m going to invest\\nin 5 years and open a new mine hoping\\nthat this is going to turn around.\\nThat\\'s how we get late this. And just to\\ngive you an idea how slow it is to build\\na mine. The average thing about mining\\nis that from discovery to production,\\nthe average lead time is how many years?\\nGive me a guess. Give me a guess. Go on.\\n16 years. Do you think that you probably\\nthought three or five, right? No. 16\\nyears. I\\'ve got a friend actually who\\nhas a gold mine. He\\'s been talking about\\nthat thing for years. They haven\\'t dug a\\nthing out of the ground yet. Now, what\\nthat means is that even we\\'re going to\\nstart building new mines today. Say\\ncopper mines, which we aren\\'t, by the\\nway. They wouldn\\'t come online until\\n2042.\\nMeaning demand is going vertical right\\nnow. Supply deficits are everywhere.\\nCopper, silver, nickel. Silver has been\\na supply deficit for\\nseven years. Seven straight years of\\nconsuming more than we mine. Eventually\\nthat math stops working, right? Because\\nwe get out of the stock piles get\\nreduced which is have a look at the\\nsilver price. Have you seen the silver\\nprice? This is the silver price, right?\\nUh was that there\\'s no one could anybody\\ncould have seen that coming. Well, if\\nyou watch my training, um, you you will\\nprobably disagree with that statement.\\nfelix.org/getfree.\\nCheck that out. So, let\\'s get into\\nspecific companies. So, I\\'m going to\\nfocus on the most interesting ones, the\\nones that are actual catalysts, real\\nprojects that aren\\'t just some, you\\nknow, explorer with a hole in the ground\\nand and a dream. So, let\\'s break down\\nsix opportunities, six stocks, and also\\ntell you how you can stay in touch with\\nthose. So, USA. Now, what I\\'m going to\\ndo here, this is in trade vision.\\nThere\\'s a link down below. you can get\\nyourself a free trial to it. I\\'m going\\nto create a watch list and we\\'re going\\nto call it mining top six and I\\'m going\\nto add these stocks to it. So, this one\\nis USA. And the really cool thing we\\'re\\ngoing to do with this is that when you\\ngo to the homepage, you can select your\\nmining top six, which obviously at the\\nmoment is just one stock. And then you\\ncan turn on the top right here, news\\nalerts. that little that little alarm\\nbell up there is news alerts. And you\\ncan do that for all of your watch lists.\\nTurn it on, turn it off. The beautiful\\nthing with that is that you\\'re then\\ngoing to get updates when something\\nhappens with these stocks that we\\nbelieve is going to move the market and\\nhappens in almost real time. And it\\nlooks something like that. You can I\\ndon\\'t know if that focuses. Does that\\nfocus? There we go. Right. So, you can\\nsee just sort of what that looks like.\\nUh and that\\'s what I get. I obviously\\nfollow a lot of stocks. You might follow\\na lot less. And it means you don\\'t have\\nto dig through the news. doesn\\'t have to\\nwonder whether something is happening.\\nYou just are informed. You\\'re just up to\\ndate. Right? So, USA is the first one.\\nNow, by the way, we started talking\\nabout that one in August last year.\\nHasn\\'t honestly done a lot since. Um, we\\nwere a little early to the to the story,\\nbut I think my humble opinion that right\\nnow is is another one of these big\\nbreakouts that we about to see. Risk\\nmanagement is key with all of these\\nbecause they\\'re fairly volatile. But\\nthey, as I say, they just got the 1.6\\nbillion from the government. That\\'s a\\npretty pretty important thing. So,\\nthey\\'re the only fully integrated\\nminetom magnet supply chain in America,\\nright? Deposit in Texas, 15 out of the\\n17 rare earths, uh, plus also lithium\\nand gallium. The government literally\\nowns 10% of a company, which means they\\nhave a vested interest. So, if you US if\\nyou\\'re a US defense contractor, um,\\nwouldn\\'t you love to have domestic\\ntariff proof supply of rare earth\\nmagnets? If you\\'re the defense\\ndepartment, you\\'re probably going to\\nguarantee the output. you\\'re going to\\nbuy it, right? So, first production here\\nis going to come online this year.\\nThat\\'s the expectation. Not 10 years\\naway, but months away. Now, what\\'s the\\nbare case? They\\'re not making anything\\nyet. It\\'s a development story, right?\\nDevelopment stories can go wrong.\\nPermits can get delayed. But given that\\nthe government owns 10%, maybe that\\nwill, you know, offset some of the risk.\\nThe mine, as I said, doesn\\'t start in\\n2028. That\\'s two years away. So, if\\nEarth prices collapse between now and\\nthen, everything changes. But, let\\'s be\\nhonest, the government isn\\'t exactly\\nknown for picking winners in the private\\nmarket. So that\\'s why I I advocate very\\nvery strong risk management for this.\\nSecond stock is MP materials. And again,\\nI\\'m going to add that to um my list. So\\nI just pop in here and I just click on\\nthe little little plus symbol here next\\nto my list. Add MP materials to the\\nlist. Yeah, there we go. Now we\\'ve got\\nit there. And then if we were to go back\\nto our\\nheat map, we can now see both of them at\\nthe same time. Right? You can see how\\nthat\\'s popping. Right? You can see how\\nit\\'s popping. You\\'re also now seeing\\nnews articles here related to your watch\\nlist. You see how how clever that is? I\\nthink it\\'s very clever. Uh so get\\nyourself a free trial to to trade vision\\nis down below. Um now MP materials and\\nand again we\\'ve talked about MP\\nmaterials in the past. I don\\'t know if I\\nhave a marker on that. I think here here\\n28th of April we had an entry point. Uh\\nwe actually I think I actually bought it\\non the 5th of June and it went on a\\nbeautiful run and it pulled back and I\\ngot out of it. Um which is what I always\\nsuggest you do. Don\\'t get married to a\\nstock. Hold it because you want to make\\nmoney out of it. They\\'re the only\\nlargecale rare earth producer in the\\nwestern hemisphere right now. They\\noperate the mountain pass mine in\\nCalifornia. They\\'re already producing.\\nSo a development story. So their board\\ncase here is that they have record\\nproduction of neodymium\\npresium.\\nHowever the heck you anybody pronounces\\nthat whatever that might be. It goes\\ninto magnets. That\\'s all I know. Um he\\ntaught me that. So, they\\'re building\\ntheir own magnet manufacturing on top of\\nthat in Texas. All things seems to\\ncenter around Texas. And they have a\\nmulti-year supply agreement with a\\nlittle company may never have heard of\\nApple. Yeah. They have partnerships with\\nthe US Department of Defense. Sorry,\\nWoo. And it\\'s an established company\\nwith real revenue, real customers, and\\nreal production. Stocks at 230% last\\nyear. Despite that run, they\\'re still\\ntrading at a significant discount to\\ntheir peak valuations. bare case. Well,\\nthey up quite a lot, right? Rare earth\\nprices are volatile. If prices drop,\\nmargins compress and blah blah blah. So,\\nthe transition from concentrate producer\\nto magnet manufacturer is also something\\nthat is riskier because they haven\\'t\\ndone it before, but this is a more\\nestablished, but you\\'re not getting at\\nthe ground floor like you might be with\\nUSA potentially, right? Stock numero is\\nUroy. We\\'re talking about that. I also\\nowned that at some point last year. So,\\nlet\\'s type that in here as well. Uroy\\nand then again we add that to our watch\\nlist here and that\\'s had also a a lovely\\nlittle run up but it\\'s still\\nsignificantly lower than it was in 2021\\nand the demand is significantly stronger\\nin my humble opinion as a financial\\nadvice. You got to do your own research\\nbut let\\'s really talk uranium here\\nbecause the AI boom is creating a\\nnuclear renaissance. Uh I also talk\\nsometimes about the fact that global\\nwarming was pitched as carbon pollution\\nonly and we should care about no other\\npollutants except for carbon. And then\\nfor some strange coincidence turns out\\nthat nuclear power produces no carbon.\\nNo, it\\'s just purely clean. There\\'s\\nnothing wrong with that whatsoever.\\nThere\\'s no radiation. There\\'s no waste.\\nIt is just a beautiful technology and we\\nshould all have one in our backyard. Um\\nat least that\\'s what Bill Gates says. So\\nall those data centers need clean power.\\nIt\\'s clean now. You see what they did?\\nDo you remember how much the world\\nloathed nuclear power after um all those\\npower plants went up and you know\\nUkraine and Japan and so on and now it\\'s\\nclean. It\\'s it\\'s good for the planet. Um\\nbut there is of course truth in it that\\nsolar and wind can\\'t do it. You actually\\nneed backup consistent power because\\nthose two are intermittent, right? when\\nthe sun doesn\\'t shine, when the wind\\ndoesn\\'t blow or it blows too much. Those\\nthings don\\'t really work. Coal and gas,\\nthey\\'re not very popular with the uh we\\nhate carbon crowd because apparently\\nthey pollute very badly. So, what what\\nhave you got left? You got nuclear. So,\\nto me, the whole thing is just a\\nbeautiful marketing scheme of the\\nnuclear industry. And and and you know,\\nyou might disagree with unviolently. Let\\nme know down below in the comments.\\nSomeone\\'s going, \"Felix, stop with the\\npolitics. You know nothing about this.\\nIt\\'s real.\" It might well be real. just\\nsaying it\\'s being hijacked, right? Um or\\nwhat what what I really love is when I\\nwhen I talk about the um Soviet\\nSocialist States of Europe, uh also\\nknown as the European Union and then and\\nthen the Europeans really kick off. You\\nhave no idea. And the funny thing about\\nthem is that they never say why I\\'m\\nwrong. They always just say it\\'s much\\nworse in other countries. That\\'s always\\nthe defense. I\\'m like, yeah, I wasn\\'t\\nsaying it wasn\\'t worse in, you know, I\\ndon\\'t know, North Korea. Uh but um I\\'m\\njust saying it\\'s not very good where you\\nare. Um, and that really takes some\\npeople off, which is kind of funny\\nreally. Anyway, um, we have offended the\\nEuropeans and the French. I\\'m I\\'m\\nkeeping keeping a score, which is good.\\nUm, apparently the French are European\\ntoo. Um, now Euroy, what about Euro?\\nThey don\\'t operate any mines. And this\\nis why I like them. They own royalty\\ninterest in uranium projects. That means\\nwhen those mines make uranium, Euroy\\ngets a percentage of the revenue\\nor production. So it\\'s passive income\\nthen your operational headaches plus\\nthey hold physical uranium probably you\\nknow under the bed uh which goes up in\\nvalue if uranium prices go up. So the\\nbull case is that tech giants like u\\nlike Microsoft\\num you know founded by one of the\\nkindest most generous most beautiful\\nsouls in the world as we all agree and\\nGoogle and Amazon they\\'re all looking at\\nnuclear power for the data scientists in\\nfact Microsoft is actually invested in\\none very heavily they all doing so\\nuranium demand is structural and it\\'s\\nlong term once you have a power plant\\nyou need more uranium so Uroy has a\\nstrong debt-free balance sheet they\\'re\\ndiversified across multiple projects not\\nnot depending on just one Right. And if\\nuranium prices go up, Euroy benefits\\ndirectly without having to dig a hole.\\nRight. What\\'s the bare case? Nuclear is\\nstill controversial in many places.\\nApparently, I\\'m controversial. Permits\\ncan take forever, but I think they\\'re\\ngoing to speed them up. And uranium\\nprices are volatile. Now, if data center\\noperators somehow decide, uh, we can do\\nall of this with, I don\\'t know, natural\\ngas or, you know, a lot of stuff and and\\non on treadmills, then maybe the rally\\nwon\\'t happen. But I like Uroy because\\nthere\\'s less downside risk. There\\'s less\\nleverage in a company like this. Now, a\\nstock numo quat is TMC, the Metals\\ncompany. It sort of says it on the tin,\\ndoesn\\'t it? So, let\\'s put TMC on our\\nlist as well. And again, add that to the\\nlist here. Bada bing. And what do they\\ndo? Well, this one\\'s a little bit wild\\nto be honest with you. It\\'s a they\\'re\\npioneering deep sea mining, right? I\\nmean, as if mining wasn\\'t difficult\\nenough, let\\'s do it underwater, like\\n10,000 ft. So, they\\'re going after poly\\nmetallic nodules. I don\\'t know what that\\nmeans, but I read it on ocean floors.\\nAnd they\\'re apparently potato- sized\\nrocks. I mean, literally, and I could\\nhave just made this up. It\\'s not like\\nanybody\\'s been down there, right?\\nThey\\'re potato- sized rocks that are\\nrich in nickel, copper, and cobalt, and\\nmanganese. I use manganesees for\\npainting, actually. It\\'s very nice. Um,\\nso basically all the stuff you need for\\nelectric vehicle batteries. They\\'re\\nsitting apparently at the bottom of the\\nPacific Ocean. As I say, they could have\\njust made it up and and it could just be\\nthe biggest Ponzi scheme in the world\\nbecause no one\\'s been down there. But\\nlet\\'s just say that\\num there is something in this because\\njust beginning of this year, they became\\nthe first company to file a consolidated\\napplication for exploration and\\ncommercial recovery under a new per US\\npermitting process. Because I imagine\\nthey went to the permitting board and\\nsaid, \"We\\'d like to dig.\" And like, \"Oh,\\nwhere\\'s your mine?\" And like, \"It isn\\'t\\na mine. It\\'s potatoes, right? Where are\\nyour potatoes?\" On the sea floor, really\\ndeep down. They\\'re like, \"Oh.\" Right.\\nAnyway, it\\'s a big deal. They\\'re ahead\\nof everybody else in that regulatory\\nframework. And they have an offtake\\nagreement with Glenor. Now, Glenor is\\none of the world\\'s largest commodity\\ntraders. They are the people who look\\nafter all the orphans and all the fluffy\\nbunnies in the world. Those kind of\\npeople. But if deep sea mining were to\\nwork, it could unlock one of the largest\\nuntapped mineral resources on the\\nplanet. Now, environmentally, it might\\nbe cleaner than traditional mining\\nbecause we\\'re not destroying mountains.\\nWe\\'re just bothering some weird looking\\nfish, so we won\\'t notice it. We\\'ll feel\\nbetter about it. Um, what\\'s the bare\\ncase? Well, it\\'s never been done before,\\never. There are huge environmental\\nconcerns. Apparently the uh the the\\nweird sort of translucent puffer fish\\nare are very concerned about it and are\\nforming a union and regulatory approval\\ncould take a while because nobody\\nunderstands what the heck these guys are\\ndoing. Tech is entirely unproving and it\\ncould be a very expensive science\\nexperience that pisses off jellyfish. So\\nthis is high risk. Uh it is also\\npotentially high reward. It\\'s a\\nspeculative play. Now can we do\\nmoonshots in a responsible way? In my\\nhumble opinion, yes. But we have to make\\nit very small. We have to have some risk\\nparameters attached around it that are\\nautomated. Again, you want to learn more\\nabout that, go watch the free\\nmasterclass, the 17-minute video,\\nfelix.org/getfree.\\nUm, so you\\'re conservative investors,\\nyou\\'re going to be shaking your head. U\\nmaybe you got a chuckle out of it. But\\nthere is somebody else. There is CRML.\\nWe\\'re going to be adding that to our\\nmining top six as well. A nice little\\nrecovery here, but actually to me that\\nlooks very good. Volume is picking up\\nsteam. Um what do they do? Well, they\\'re\\nan exploration company. They sort of go\\nthrough the jungle and they look for the\\num you know, Raiders of the Lost Ark\\ntype thing. And they found something\\ncalled the Tambre Rare Earth Project in\\nguess where? Penguin Land, Greenland.\\nSo, they\\'ve done some recent drilling um\\nthat confirmed they have highgrade\\nmineralization, particularly heavy rare\\nearths. They\\'re planning a joint venture\\nto build a rare earth processing\\nfacilities with the penguins. So this is\\nan earlier stage than USA or MP\\nmaterials, but it is a worldclass asset\\nin a I was going to say stable\\njurisdiction. I\\'m not sure that\\'s\\nentirely true. No, I actually think\\nGreenland\\'s a very stable jurisdiction.\\nI think Trump never really was going to\\ninvade it or anything insane like that.\\nHe just goes in and he says, \"I want\\nit.\" And then they say, \"Well, we don\\'t\\nwant to do that.\" up and you say, \"Well,\\nI cannot have the mineral rights and can\\nI do whatever I want?\" And then they go,\\n\"Yeah.\" Right? So anyway, risk, no\\nproduction yet. Um, years away from from\\nfrom revenue. Um, but you know, penguin\\nmanagement, right? So, you got to you\\ngot to take your pick here. Uh, here\\'s\\nanother one. Um, this is a gold stock.\\nAnd if you\\'ve been asleep on the whole\\ngold trend, gold is uh it\\'s done\\nrelatively well.\\nAll right. Relatively well. Uh it\\'s been\\na it\\'s been a good year for us because\\nwe started getting into gold miners at\\naround about May last year I think right\\nwhen gold and it gold didn\\'t do anything\\nfor a while but then gold caught up and\\nnow gold is up 56%.\\nBut a gold company here called Guro and\\nagain I\\'m going to add that to our list\\num five down and one one left to go is\\nalso had a very good year. Now as you\\ncan see this is a little bit of of a of\\na of a of a cyclical beast. So, this was\\none one\\'s trading at $31. It\\'s trading\\nat $161 right now. Yeah, that\\'s down a\\nlot. I\\'m just going to leave it at that.\\nActually, let me go on a on a month\\nchart and then I might be able to\\nsqueeze it on the chart here. How much\\nis that down, mate? Anybody? We\\'re down\\n94%.\\nSo, say the insane thing was going to\\nhappen and it would recover back to\\noriginal levels because I\\'m not\\npromising you that would be a 1,000 but\\na 2,000% gain. And again, that\\'s not\\ndefinitely not a promise of of those\\nkind of crazy outcomes. What do they do?\\nThey\\'re a precious metal producer. They\\nhad a major operational turnaround in\\nlate 2025. They started identifying as a\\npotentially profitable business again.\\nWhereas prior to that, they were just a\\nbunch of lunatics running the asylum.\\nAnd they have highgrade production from\\nthe three sisters area at the Don David\\nGold Mine in Mexico. Didn\\'t you like how\\nI just said like I knew where that was?\\nI have no idea why that is, but\\napparently it is in Mexico. And that\\ndrove strong cash flow. The company is\\ndebtree, which doesn\\'t really happen to\\nmining companies. Silver accounts for\\nthe majority of their revenue. And\\nsilver, if you\\'ve been asleep, has\\nindustrial uses. Solar panels,\\nelectronics, every AI chip has silver in\\nit. And they\\'re also advancing the back\\n40 project in Michigan, which is a large\\nscale development in the US. The risk is\\num they\\'re operating in Mexicans, right?\\nTequila is good. Uh the food has\\napparently an impact on your digestion.\\nAnd I\\'m sorry, my Mexican friends. You\\nknow what I\\'m saying? It is a uh it is\\nnot essentially the most um how shall I\\nput it? Uh law abiding, you know, sort\\nof space. Uh that\\'s kind of the risk\\nhere. Goro. Now, did we miss one? MP\\nTSMC user. We didn\\'t put the last one on\\nthe list, right? CRML. Did we add other\\nto the list? We did not. CRML Winston,\\nyou should pay attention, right? Let\\'s\\nadd that to the list here, too. And then\\nwe can go and look at our new heat map\\nand we\\'re now informed about this. We\\'ve\\ngot a little alert bell. So, we\\'re going\\nto get notifications and we can also see\\nthe news articles in here. And then if\\nyou want to go back to looking at, you\\nknow, just the S&P 500, you can go back\\nto the S&P 500. You want to switch back\\nto your uh mining top six list, you\\nknow, you you\\'ve got your mining top six\\nlist. So, and in in trade vision, what\\ncould go wrong? Well, um, mining is\\ncyclical. That\\'s really what I want to\\nsay on that subject. I\\'m going to give\\nyou a little bit more more detail than\\nthat. Um, commodities can swing 20 to\\n30% in a week. Um, China could cut off\\nexports. It could flood the market one\\nway or the other. Uh, and what if\\ntechnology changes? What if we get, I\\ndon\\'t know, fusion power in a, you know,\\nin your your coffee cup. Um, or or we\\nget new magnet technology that doesn\\'t\\nneed any magnets or technology or or\\nminerals. Uh apparently uh there is a\\npotential replacement for silver. The\\nsolar industry is working on that. So if\\nprices go up too much, people are going\\nto try and find an alternative. That\\'s\\nthe risk, but it\\'s probably going to\\ntake quite a long time. We also have\\nregulatory issues, execution, maybe\\nyou\\'re late. Um but what\\'s the big\\npicture? Well, the government has put\\n$1.6 billion into this. This not the\\nfirst investment in the rare earth\\nsector. The AI boom is building this\\nmassive infrastructure that\\'s all going\\nto need more of these metals, including\\nsilver. So, I think we\\'re at the early\\nstages of a metal super cycle. Winston,\\nany thoughts? Shall we wake him?\\nWinston, what do you think about the\\nmetal super cycle? It\\'s not a go for it.\\nI go back to sleep. Um, all right. So,\\nif we hit a global recession, you\\nthere\\'s all that stuff that can happen.\\nSo, I\\'m not telling you to buy anything.\\nI\\'m not saying this is guaranteed. I\\'m\\nnot saying there aren\\'t risk. Do your\\nown research on the stands. The risk\\nsize appropriately. That\\'s the most\\nimportant thing with anything. But, I\\nthink it\\'s a sector worth paying\\nattention to. Fundamentals are real. We\\ngot demand. We got deficit. and supply.\\nWe got government intervention and if\\nthe super cycle plays out, I think we\\ncan make some real money here over the\\nnext 3 to 10 years, but it\\'s not a\\npromise of future outcomes. Smart money\\nis already moving in. So, if you want to\\nlearn\\nhow to pick those stocks, how to pick\\nthose sectors, how to position, and all\\nthat kind of good stuff, then please\\nwatch the mini masterclass at\\nfelix.org/getree.\\nGet yourself informed by hopping onto\\nTrade Vision and make sure you actually\\nknow what the heck\\'s going on here\\nbecause this happens every single day.\\nWe only give you the news that we think\\nis going to move the market like live.\\nWe don\\'t give you all the noise and\\njibber and\\nbollocks political opinion on stuff.\\nObviously, I spout some out, but I\\ngenerally just take the piss out of\\nwhoever is is is running um the country.\\nUh whoever thinks they\\'re running the\\ncountry, which might be a whole another\\nconversation. So, understand the risk.\\nIf you got some value out of this, well,\\nhelp some other poor folks out and share\\nthis video. And that\\'s all I would say.\\nAnd Winston, any final words? Come here.\\nCome on. Come on, Winston.\\nCome on.\\nOh, you sleepy creature. We did a long\\nhike yesterday, which was lovely. And\\nthen he did a pretty tough playtime this\\nmorning with his friends, so that\\'s why\\nhe\\'s looking as sleepy as he is. I wish\\nyou guys a uh beautiful, successful\\nyear. All the best.
